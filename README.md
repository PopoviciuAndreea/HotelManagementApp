## Hotel Management Application
This project is a console-based application developed using Java Spring Boot and an H2 database, designed to manage hotel reservations efficiently. The application provides an intuitive interface that allows users to interact with the system through a series of guided menu options.

Key features of the application include:

**1. Location-Based Hotel Search:**

Users can input their current latitude and longitude, along with a search radius (in kilometers), to find nearby hotels.

**2. Reservation Management:**

Create New Reservations: Users can book a room by selecting from available options.

Cancel Reservations: Reservations can be canceled up to 2 hours before the check-in date; otherwise, an informative message will be displayed.

Modify Room Selection: Users can update their reservation details, such as changing the room type, within the allowed timeframe.

**3. Feedback Submission:**

Guests can provide feedback on their stay, enhancing service quality and user satisfaction.

**4. User Guidance and Error Handling:**

The application provides clear and user-friendly error messages whenever invalid data is entered, guiding users to correct their input step-by-step.

This application ensures robust functionality and a seamless user experience by implementing checks and validations for all input data.
